    "# Morphology Learner: Interpretable Machine Learning for Form-Meaning Mappings\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores how decision trees can be used to learn the mappings between *forms*–words or subparts of words–and their *meanings*, which are expressed in terms of binary features. As an illustration, for English third-person subject pronouns (*he*, *she*, *they*, *it*), a possible mapping we want the learner to learn might be as follows: \n",

    "\n",
    "In this project, synthetic data is generated to simulate mappings between *forms* and *meanings*. Each sample in the synthetic data consists of:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **X** – a vector of binary feature values for all features, where `0` represents a minus value (-) and `1` represents a plus value (+).  \n",
    "2. **y** – the corresponding morph (word form).  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the first feature is ±Plural, the second is ±Animate, and the third is ±Feminine, a sample could be:  \n",
    "\n",
    "X = [0, 1, 1] # −Plural +Animate +Feminine\n",
    "y = she\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is generated from *morphological paradigms*, which specify the morph corresponding to each combination of feature values. For example, for English third-person subject pronouns, a possible paradigm is:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature specification          | Morph |\n",
    "|--------------------------------|-------|\n",
    "| −Plural −Animate −Feminine      | it    |\n",

    "| +Plural +Animate −Feminine      | they  |\n",
    "| +Plural +Animate +Feminine      | they  |\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Learning form-meaning mappings is not just regurgitating the paradigm. For instance, \"they\" appears in three different cells in the paradigm. A naive learner could generate three separate rules for \"they,\" one for each cell. The goal, however, is to learn a **single generalized rule**:  \n",
    "> - +Plural ↔ they\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `generate_data_from_csv` takes a morphological paradigm (which is provided as a CSV file) and two additional parameters: \n",
    "- `accuracy_rate` – the probability that a generated sample uses the correct morph for a feature value combination from the paradigm\n",
    "- `n` – the total number of samples to generate.  \n",
    "> Each sample is generated by randomly picking a feature value combination (cell) from the paradigm. Then, with probability = accuracy_rate, this combination is paired with the correct morph from the paradigm. Otherwise, it is paired with a different morph, randomly chosen.\n",

    "- A list of feature names in the paradigm in the CSV file \n",
    "- A list of unique morphs in the paradigm in the CSV file\n",
    "- A matrix of binary feature values 0 or 1 (each row corresponds to a sample, and each column corresponds to a feature)\n",
    "- A vector of morphs (one per sample)\n",
    "- Error rate - the proportion of samples where a feature value combination is associated with an incorrect morph\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us see illustrate this function by applying it to the full English person pronoun paradigm (`English_pronouns.csv`). Besides the third-person subject pronouns illustrates above, this paradigm also includes first- and second-person pronouns (e.g., *I*, *we*, *you*), as well as object pronouns (e.g., *me*, *him*, *them*) and possessive pronouns (*my*, *your*, *their*). \n",
    "\n",
    "Following linguistic convention, different person combinations are represented using two features, Participant and Author: \n",

Likewise, the pronoun *it* can be used in both subject and object positions, so instead of having two rules for *it*, we only have one that is not specified for the feature Subject.
